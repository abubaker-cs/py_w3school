# Python Comments
print("To use the comments, just add # before the line")

# Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line:
print("The comment will be added at the end of this line")  # Like this

# A comment does not have to be text that explains the code, it can also be used to prevent Python from executing code:
# print("Hello, World!")

# Python does not really have a syntax for multiline comments.

# This
# will
# be a
# multiline
# comment
